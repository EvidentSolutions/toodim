#  TODO

- better color scheme 
- scroll through the game
- better layout if rotated board (width larger than height)
- export game (to some third-party server?)

missing end game rules:
- repetition for draw
- impasse

cool to have:
- show pieces that can move?
- better animation
- stronger border for promotion area?
- knight move as 3d-arc to show that jumping over is fine?
- same kind of captured pieces not wasting space so much with duplicate pieces?
  - maybe in some deterministic order
